Remember that the path you choose to follow is yours, and yours alone.

No one can force you to walk it, you are the one who decided to give every single step.

You are the one who decides when to go forward.

And you are the one who decides when it ends.

At least you can have that. It may not be the best advice, but it should give you some comfort if you know that at least, you can control your life
