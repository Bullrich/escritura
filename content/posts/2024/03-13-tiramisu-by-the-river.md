Smiles may be temporal. But your smile is imprinted in me. 

Making you smile is an achievement in my day. 

Making you laugh is a miracle in my routine. 

And making you happy is my goal in life. 

I love you. Today, tomorrow and every other day. 

I love you. Here and by the river. 

I love you. With hope and with love. 

Can you be my valentine even though today is not valentine? ‘Cause I love you from morning till night. Even in my dreams, I dream about you.
