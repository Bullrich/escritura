I love being with you, just you.<br/>
I love hearing your yawns in the morning, your laugh during the day, and your questions during the evening.<br/>
I love how your slang confuses me. I love learning them.<br/>
I love how you make me feel, excited, for the future.

I love being with you, every day and any day. That is what happiness is to me: You.

I love you.
