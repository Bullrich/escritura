I had to write a short story where the writing prompts were the following:
The main character is a person with lots and lots of cats and says yes to everything, and in the story I have to mention a wedding and apparitions. 
This is the result:

# What could be wed

Moreau walked into the aisle, she was being escorted by Sandy, her step mother. Moreau was wearing a bridal veil, it made her look like an angel, although sometimes it would get caught in her whiskers, bringing her some discomfort.

While she was walking to the altar, she could see him waiting. Bruno was standing completely still, admiring her. He was wearing a blue tie that matched his eyes. His black hair was properly combed to the back of his head and showed his more prominent features.

He locked eyes with her. She smiled, he didn’t. He was nervous, this was a turning point in his life. After begging to her for so long, she finally accepted and this should be the happiest moment of his life. So why was he feeling like this? Why was he feeling such an empty void in his heart?

Was he having second thoughts?

Before he could go down this rabbit hole she was already in front of him, next to him and with him, in the altar.

The priest open the book in his old and withered hands and he spoke,

“We are surrounded here by our beloved, who, under their own will, wish to engage in the sacred tradition of marriage...”

Every seat in the church was occupied, with the exception of one. A white and red cushioned seat in the first row of the bride’s side; a seat reserved for Moreau’s father, Paco, who wasn’t there. He had left them 7 moons ago when he left to recover his honor.

“Bruno, do you take Moreau’s hand as your bride, and promise to love her, protect her and be faithful to her, in both health and sickness?”

Bruno wasn’t sure of what to say, he didn’t want to answer this question with a lie. He looked at her straight in her green eyes, which were shining with a spark of hope.

She smiled at him, and with that smile next to those two emeralds, under his eyes she was the most beautiful in the world.

And at this moment all his doubts were gone.

He smiled back at her. He opened his mouth but couldn’t talk; chaos emerged from the opposite side of the room.

A dark figure stomped through the main doors, angry, and bearing bad news to everyone.

It was Paco.

Two nights ago Paco found out a terrible secret that was destroying him. He found out the truth about his daughter’s pretender.

His wife, the mother of Moreau, left him for someone shortly after they had their first child born. And she had a new child with this other one.

The second child of his wife was Bruno.

Moreau was about to marry her step brother.

In an instant Paco ran towards Bruno, jumping on him and pinning him to the ground.

“What’s the meaning of this Paco? I thought you left us”, cried the old priest.

But Paco didn’t answer him, he meowed angrily at Bruno, who was trying to attack back.

The old priest grabbed Paco but he scrached him with his claws and made him bleed. Moreau ran to help Bruno while all the cats were meowing from their seats.

The old priest, angry, screamed: “You are not going to ruin this wedding” and to the horror of everyone he grabbed his lemon scented cat spray from within his tunics.

Every cat jumped out of their chair in fear, he brought that which they hate the most, not even the effect of the catnip could nullify that fear.

The priest, surrounded by the wave of cats, started shooting the spray everywhere, causing a commotion. Every cat was hiding under a chair.

And in the midst of the confusion, Paco slashed Bruno, cutting very deeply his face while Moreau watched in horror.

The old priest reacted by spraying more lemon juice on Paco, but they were interrupted by an explosion.

The corner of the room was wrapped in purple flames, which danced and twisted into a tall rectangle which went from floor to ceiling, and from that rectangle two figures emerged.

One of those figures was a tall man wearing a dark cloak, hiding his body under an ominous aura. The other figure was another man, young, wearing an expensive suit, and having a confused look on his face. He looked similar to the priest, but younger, and more confident in himself.

“And this is what you will become,” said the dark figure while pointing out the feline chaos in the room, “if you don’t restrict yourself and learn when to say no”.

The young version of the priest fell on his knees and cried in front of the dark figure, grabbing his cloak and shouting.

“Show me no more future specter, I have learned my lesson and I promise that I will change”.

“Then thou had learnt thy future”

And in another purple explosion the two figures disappeared, leaving the priest, alone, surrounded by the many cats in an empty church, and he, in confusion, screamed, “What the fuck just happened?”, before the cats ran away from the room to hide outside.
