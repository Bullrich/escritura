Oshino said, with a broad grin. <br>
“Then, your wish?” <br>
“......I want you to teach me a way to make everyone happy.”

I put into words.<br>
The wish from the bottom of my heart.<br>
“A way to end things without anyone being unhappy.”<br>
“As if it existed.”

Are you stupid, Oshino shrugged his shoulders.<br>
“There’s a limit even to convenience. That’s a theme written by grade schoolers in moral classes. It’s not realistic.”<br>
“Oshino -- I...”

“However.”<br>
He takes out from his mouth the cigarette and put it back into his pocket.<br>
Oshino Meme looks at Hanekawa, at Kissshot, and at me in turn -- and says.

>“There would be a way to make everyone unhappy.”

He swiftly explains it to us who are dumbfounded at his words.<br>
“In other words, I’m talking about distributing onto everybody the burden of unhappiness generated by this situation -- nobody will have his wish fulfilled, but if that’s fine with you, the way exists.”

“............” <br>
Everyone will become unhappy -- everyone will be burdened with unhappiness.

Distributing.

Subdividing -- the burden.

This is certainly not something to push onto a single person.
